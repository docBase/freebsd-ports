Pulumi Terraform Remote State Resource Provider enables accessing and using
Terraform remote state data within Pulumi programs. This allows organizations
migrating from Terraform to Pulumi to reference existing Terraform-managed
resources and gradually transition their infrastructure.

This provider reads Terraform state files from various backends and makes
the outputs available to Pulumi programs.
