Pulumi Standard Library (pulumi-std) provides a collection of standard
library functions for use in Pulumi programs. These functions provide
common operations like string manipulation, encoding/decoding, and
other utility functions that can be used across different Pulumi
providers and languages.

This plugin provides the pulumi-resource-std binary which implements
the standard library as a Pulumi resource provider.
