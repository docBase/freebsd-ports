Pulumi YAML Language Plugin enables writing Pulumi infrastructure as code
using YAML syntax. This plugin provides both a language host for running
YAML-based Pulumi programs and a converter for transforming YAML to other
Pulumi languages.

YAML is a simple, declarative way to define cloud infrastructure that's
ideal for simpler use cases and getting started with Pulumi.
